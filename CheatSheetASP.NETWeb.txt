Bob Cheat Sheet ASP.NET Web Applications

CS-ASP_Lesson 003 My First Web Form 6/11/15
notes:
- Created a new Web App by default kept it empty
- Added a web form named 'Default'
- Added "Server Controls" (Textboxes, Button, Label)
- Altered the 'Programatic ID' of the Textbox (How we reference and access the Textbox in code)
- (Properties, ID , pascal case Identifier with discription of intent, purpose, responsibility)
   ie firstNameTextBox, lastNameTextBox, okButton...etc
- Button - changed programatic ID, & Text Propertie to display Click Me
- Lable - changed the programatic ID, & Text Property to display an empty String
         => this item exists and it has no default text in it. "design time"
- Double click click Me Button
- Default.aspx.cs = C# code
- inside the okButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
   methods scope 
}  



CS-ASP_Lesson 004 Understanding What You Just Did 6/11/15

- Intellisense . (member accessor) shows all the available properties associated with object
- Relationship between Default.aspx & Default.aspx.cs the code behind "Code that sits behind the actual form" 
   C# code executes on a server somewhere & the Form is what is DELIVERED / DISPLAYED to a end user.
- Server Controls - give your web form functionality (ie Login controls, Check boxes, Buttons..etc)
- Server controls perform a specific  task really well ie TextBox is an input for textual information. end user sends
   alpha numeric characters to your program
- Button end user can choose to perform an action , Do something now 
- Lable is good at displaying  information, end result message our program

- We can see the Methods availabe to a particular object via drop down.
- when event objects ie Click EXECUTED the Event handler is executed and any business logic you have written will be executed

- Using the Programatic ID we either store or retrieve Alpha numeric characters "String" in variables 'Wired together' so to speak
- Whenever we need to get back at those string values we can reference them via whatever we have named them
